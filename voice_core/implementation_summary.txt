# RAG Implementation Summary

## Overview

The implementation enhances the voice agent with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities in two key ways:

1. **Transcript Enhancement**: The system learns from user corrections to improve future transcriptions, creating a continuously improving speech recognition experience.

2. **Contextual Response Generation**: The system retrieves relevant prior conversation fragments to enhance LLM responses, making them more personalized and context-aware.

## Key Components

### 1. Memory Client Enhancements
- Added methods for storing and retrieving transcript corrections
- Implemented RAG context retrieval for LLM prompts
- Added caching for performance optimization
- Enhanced connection reliability with retry logic

### 2. Voice Agent Modifications
- Updated transcript handling to apply learned corrections
- Added user correction processing capabilities
- Implemented RAG-enhanced response generation
- Added metrics tracking for performance monitoring

### 3. Tensor Server Updates
- Added handlers for correction storage
- Implemented transcript correction lookup
- Enhanced memory search for RAG context

### 4. LLM Pipeline Improvements
- Added RAG context incorporation
- Implemented query-type detection for targeted prompting
- Enhanced response processing for voice output
- Added error handling and retry strategies

## Technologies Used

- **LiveKit**: For real-time audio communication
- **Edge TTS**: For high-quality voice synthesis
- **WebSockets**: For communication with memory system
- **Levenshtein Distance**: For validating corrections
- **Caching**: For optimizing frequent operations

## Design Principles

1. **Resilience**: The system gracefully handles failures in any component without crashing
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works even when advanced features fail
3. **Continuous Learning**: The system improves over time through user corrections
4. **Context-Awareness**: Responses incorporate relevant historical context
5. **Voice Optimization**: All output is optimized for spoken delivery

## Performance Considerations

- **Latency Control**: Added timeouts and fallbacks to maintain conversational flow
- **Memory Efficiency**: Implemented cache size limits and cleanup
- **Error Recovery**: Added multiple retry strategies for various failure modes

## Security and Privacy

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs and corrections are validated before processing
- **Error Exposure**: Errors are logged but presented to users in a controlled manner
- **Connection Security**: WebSocket connections use appropriate timeouts and retry logic

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-Turn Context**: Enhanced support for maintaining context across multiple turns
2. **Proactive Corrections**: System could suggest corrections for ambiguous phrases
3. **Personalization**: Adaptive RAG retrieval based on user interaction patterns
4. **Content Filtering**: Better handling of inappropriate content in corrections
