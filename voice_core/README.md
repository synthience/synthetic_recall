# Voice Core System Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to address critical issues in the voice assistant pipeline.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Transcription.__init__() Error

**Problem**: The voice assistant was using an incorrect format for the Transcription API, causing errors when trying to publish transcriptions.

**Fix**: Updated all components to use the correct Transcription API structure with segments, track_sid, and participant identity.

**Files Modified**:
- `voice_state_manager.py`: Updated `handle_stt_transcript` method
- `enhanced_stt_service.py`: Updated `_publish_transcript_to_ui` method
- `interruptible_tts_service.py`: Updated `_publish_transcription` method

### 2. Multi-Turn Flow Hanging

**Problem**: The voice assistant would hang during multi-turn conversations, failing to transition back to the LISTENING state.

**Fix**: Improved state transition logic, added timeout handling for LLM processing, and ensured proper buffer clearing after each turn.

**Files Modified**:
- `agent2.py`: Added timeout handling in `_handle_transcript` method
- `voice_state_manager.py`: Enhanced `start_speaking` method to ensure transitions to LISTENING
- `interruptible_tts_service.py`: Added explicit state transitions after TTS completion

### 3. "Task was destroyed but it is pending!" Error

**Problem**: Asyncio tasks were not being properly managed, leading to "Task was destroyed but it is pending!" errors.

**Fix**: Implemented proper task cancellation and cleanup with appropriate exception handling.

**Files Modified**:
- `voice_state_manager.py`: Improved task management in `start_speaking` method
- `agent2.py`: Added proper task handling in `_handle_transcript` method

## Testing the Fixes

### Automated Tests

Run the automated tests to verify the fixes:

```bash
python -m tests.test_voice_fixes
```

These tests verify:
- Correct Transcription API usage with segments
- Multi-turn conversation flow without hanging
- LLM timeout handling
- TTS interruption handling

### Demo Script

Run the demo script to see the fixes in action:

```bash
python run_voice_assistant_demo.py
```

Optional arguments:
- `--room`: LiveKit room name (default: "demo-room")
- `--url`: LiveKit server URL (default: "ws://localhost:7880")
- `--api-key`: LiveKit API key (default: "devkey")
- `--api-secret`: LiveKit API secret (default: "secret")
- `--identity`: Participant identity (default: auto-generated)
- `--debug`: Enable debug logging

### Manual Testing

To manually test the fixes:

1. Start the LiveKit server:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d livekit
   ```

2. Run the voice assistant:
   ```bash
   python server/run_voice_server.py
   ```

3. Connect to the LiveKit Agents Playground:
   - Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
   - Connect to the same room as the voice assistant

4. Test multi-turn conversations:
   - Speak a phrase and wait for the response
   - Speak another phrase immediately after the response
   - Verify that the assistant responds to each input without hanging

5. Test interruptions:
   - Start speaking while the assistant is responding
   - Verify that the assistant stops speaking and processes your new input

## Implementation Details

### Sequence Tracking for Transcripts

Added sequence numbers to ensure transcripts are displayed in the correct order in the UI:

```python
self._transcript_sequence += 1
sequence = self._transcript_sequence
```

### LLM Timeout Handling

Added timeout handling to prevent hanging during LLM processing:

```python
try:
    response = await asyncio.wait_for(llm_task, timeout=15.0)
    # Process response
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    # Handle timeout
```

### State Transition Guarantees

Added finally blocks to ensure state transitions happen even after errors:

```python
finally:
    # Ensure transition to LISTENING after each turn
    if self.state_manager.current_state not in [VoiceState.ERROR, VoiceState.INTERRUPTED]:
        await self.state_manager.transition_to(VoiceState.LISTENING)
```

### Proper Task Cancellation

Implemented proper task cancellation with exception handling:

```python
if self._current_tts_task and not self._current_tts_task.done():
    self._current_tts_task.cancel()
    try:
        await self._current_tts_task
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        pass
