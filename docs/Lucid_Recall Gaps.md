Below is a summary
of the major gaps and missing links in the current codebase, specifically
regarding how it should handle HPC inference at input time, dynamic “surprise”
and “forget” logic, and the hypersphere-based normalizations. These
observations are based on comparing the Titan Memory Server (and model)
implementation with the HPC pipeline code you shared (the
“HypersphereTokenFlow,” “HPCFlowManager,” “preserveDiversity,” “shock
absorber,” etc.) and the stated goal of a truly “online” HPC-based memory
approach:

1. No Integration of
   the HPC Pipeline (HypersphereTokenFlow) in TitanMemoryModel

What we have:

In the
TitanMemoryModel, we see a feedforward approach for forward() and trainStep(),
with a mention of “manifoldStep” if useManifold === true, but it is mostly a
standard MLP with a “forgetGate,” plus a simple MSE-based “surprise.”

In the HPC code, we
have an entire “HypersphereTokenFlow” (and “HPCFlowManager” or “webglCompute”)
that does chunk-based partial HPC, “shock absorber,” “preserveDiversity,” and
advanced “momentum/forget” logic.

The gap:

 None of that HPC pipeline code is called or
even referenced in the TitanMemoryModel. The TitanMemoryModel is basically
ignorant of chunk-based HPC.

There’s no usage of
HypersphereTokenFlow.processChunks() or .applyShockAbsorber() or
.preserveDiversity().

The HPC approach is
effectively an independent flow, but TitanMemoryModel is not hooking into it.

Why it matters:

 The HPC system is where the advanced
“long-term memory on a hypersphere,” “surprise-based gating,” and “forgetting
across large sequences” happen. If we do not unify them, the
“TitanMemoryServer” remains a simple MLP with MSE-based training, missing the
HPC approach described in your research/papers.

2. “Surprise” and
   “Forgetfulness” in HPC Are Not Used in TitanMemoryModel

What we have:

HPC pipeline code
uses advanced “surprise metric,” e.g., bigger than a threshold triggers a
“shock absorber,” and also has momentum-based partial forgetting.

TitanMemoryModel has
a simpler “surprise” = MSE between predicted and x. Also a single “forgetGate,”
updated via standard Adam in each training step.

The gap:

HPC
“shockThreshold,” “shockAbsorberApplied,” or “momentum-based gating” is absent
in the Titan memory MLP.

The forgetGate is
just a learned scalar, not “decaying memory vectors” in HPC style.

HPC’s key idea is
chunk-based or streaming “forget” logic triggered by “surprise.” But
TitanMemoryModel does not do that.

Why it matters:

 The “forget mechanism” in HPC is more dynamic
than just a single scalar gate. HPC code normalizes embeddings chunk-by-chunk,
checks “shock thresholds,” or “preserveDiversity,” then re-injects tokens.
Without hooking into HPC, the Titan model is missing the advanced memory
management that your research mentions.

3. No “Chunked HPC
   Processing” for Incoming Data in the TitanMemoryServer

What we have:

HPCFlowManager (and
HypersphereTokenFlow) has code to handle large sequences by chunking them,
applying the diversity or shock absorber, normalizing on the hypersphere, etc.

The
TitanMemoryServer’s “train_sequence” just loops over the array of vectors but
does a normal forward/training.

The gap:

We never call
HypersphereTokenFlow.processChunks(), or HPCFlowManager’s
“chunkedHypersphereNormalize.”

The HPC chunk-based
approach is effectively separate from the server’s approach.

So “HPC at input
time” is not actually happening from the server endpoints.

Why it matters:

The HPC approach you
want is specifically about online chunk-based processing. If the
TitanMemoryServer does not route input sequences through HPCFlowManager, you
lose the entire HPC advantage for “long sequence / large context” scenarios.

4. No “Memory
   Integration” with HPC’s Surprises or Momentum

What we have:

HPC code:
momentum-based or multi-step approach (“processEmbeddings,” “shock absorber,”
etc.).

TitanMemoryModel: A
single-step forward pass plus an Adam-based training step.

The gap:

HPC “momentum,”
“shock absorber” (like partialShockAbsorber or surprise-based gating) is not
integrated with the Titan memory MLP’s forward pass.

The HPC system is
never told about the model’s internal memory state nor does the Titan model
feed HPC “embedding tokens.”

Why it matters:

 HPC “momentum-based updates” are central to
performing “online Riemannian optimization,” whereas TitanMemoryModel is just a
feedforward MLP. If we want truly “online HPC memory,” we need to unify them.

5. “Hypersphere
   Normalization” & “PreserveDiversity” Not Applied to Titan Memory States

What we have:

HPC pipeline:
preserveDiversity(), projectToHypersphere(), computePairwiseSimilarity().

TitanMemoryModel: We
do not see references to “similarities,” “diversity thresholds,” or “norming
memory states.”

The gap:

The TitanMemory
“memoryVec” is stored as a variable in the MLP, but we never apply HPC’s
spherical or geodesic logic to that memory vector.

HPC has code for
normalizing embeddings chunk-by-chunk, but TitanMemory does no chunk-based HPC
for memory.

Why it matters:

The entire concept
from your HPC approach/paper that memory “resides on a hypersphere” is missing
in the MLP’s code.

For HPC to “learn at
test time,” we need HPC retractions, slerp or “linear steps plus re-norm,” etc.

Right now, Titan
memory is just Euclidean-l2 with a single forgetGate.

6. Tools &
   Endpoints from the MCP Are Not Mapped to HPC Tools

What we have:

The MCP “callTool”
endpoints revolve around init_model, train_step, etc. purely for
TitanMemoryModel.

HPC or advanced
memory tools (like shock_absorber, preserveDiversity, “momentum decay control,”
etc.) are not exposed as an MCP “tool.”

The gap:

If we want the user
or external client to do HPC inference at input time, we also need an MCP tool
that triggers HPC code. Possibly a new “hpc_process” or “embedding_process.”

Similarly, if HPC is
the default pipeline for new data, we need the server to call HPCFlowManager
internally after user input or as part of train_step.

Why it matters:

Without mapping HPC
logic into the MCP layer, the memory server cannot be driven externally to do
HPC chunk-based flows.

7. “Knowledge Store”
   Is Not HPC-Processed

What we have:

The
TitanExpressServer has endpoints to “storeKnowledge” or “retrieveKnowledge.”

HPC code is not used
to embed or chunk this knowledge.

The gap:

If we want HPC-based
memory management for knowledge items, we’d presumably chunk large knowledge
“documents,” do HPC normalization, store them, etc.

None of that occurs.
We just store the raw JSON content.

Why it matters:

HPC is presumably
about “hyper-sphere memory,” so we probably want to embed or transform new
knowledge through HPC flow.

Right now, knowledge
is just a static JSON in a file.

8. Node 16 + WebGL +
   TensorFlow.js “Gotchas”

What we have:

Code references
“Node 16 is the only version that works with WebGL,” but we also see a partial
usage of “@tensorflow/tfjs-node-gpu,” which typically uses CUDA on Node, not
WebGL.

The HPC references
“browser WebGL compute” as well, including use of document, “canvas,” etc.

The gap:

On Node 16, using
WebGL in a headless environment is tricky—requires headless-gl or custom
contexts. The code does not show any bridging for that.

If the plan is to
run HPC code in the browser environment, that’s also not integrated with the
TitanMemoryServer, which is an Express Node server.

Why it matters:

There is a risk that
HPC code that expects a DOM or canvas for WebGL will not run in Node 16.

We might need a
consistent approach, e.g. either run HPC in the browser or use tfjs-node-gpu
with CUDA for HPC.

9. No Unified
   “Test-Time Learning” Flow

What we have:

HPC code in your
“HypersphereTokenFlow” is all about “learning to memorize at test time.”

TitanMemoryModel is
a typical training setup (trainStep, forward), not specifically “retrain at
test time.”

The gap:

We do not see a
method that at inference time (i.e., at each user query), the HPC system
updates memory with “past surprise.”

We want a user’s
query to trigger HPC-based memory updates. Currently, we have no endpoint in
the server that does HPC “displacement steps” or “shock absorber.”

Why it matters:

The entire HPC
concept of “embedding space updated on the fly” or “momentum-based memory
updates after each token” is missing from the actual server logic.

Recommendations to
Close These Gaps

Integrate HPCFlow or
HypersphereTokenFlow into TitanMemoryModel

For each input (like
in train_sequence or train_step), pass embeddings through HPCFlow’s “chunked”
or “shock absorber” pipeline.

Incorporate HPC’s
momentum-based update or “preserveDiversity” steps to transform input data or
memory vectors.

Expose HPC Tools in
MCP

Introduce new tools
(e.g., hpc_process, apply_shock, preserve_diversity) that explicitly call the
HPCFlow.

Or unify them under
the existing “train_step” or “forward_pass” so those steps call HPC code
before/after running the MLP.

Use HPC “Surprise”
to Trigger “Shock Absorber”

Instead of only
MSE-based “surprise,” incorporate HPC’s measure of novelty or “diff from
manifold” to decide if we call applyShockAbsorber.

Chunking

If a user sends a
large sequence, automatically chunk it in the HPCFlow. On each chunk,
preserveDiversity, projectToHypersphere, etc.

Manifold & HPC
Are Distinct

The
TitanMemoryModel’s manifoldStep() is a simplified approach. HPC code has a more
advanced approach (shock absorber, momentum). Consider merging or letting HPC
code fully handle “manifold updates.”

Coordinate Node vs.
Browser

If you must run HPC
in Node with GPU, consider using tfjs-node-gpu (CUDA) or a WebGL headless
approach. The current code partly references “window.tf,”
“document.createElement,” etc. That works only in a browser or with a
node-canvas setup.

Load HPCFlowManager
in TitanMemoryServer

On server init,
create an HPCFlowManager instance. In each request (like /trainStep), pass the
input through HPCFlowManager’s pipeline first. Then feed the HPC output into
TitanMemoryModel. Conversely, any memory update in TitanMemoryModel can be sent
back to HPCFlow for consistency.

Knowledge / RAG

If you want
HPC-based memory for knowledge, chunk knowledge documents, run HPC
transformations, store them in a vector DB, etc. The “storeKnowledge” route
could do HPCFlow calls on the text embeddings. Right now, it is just raw JSON.

Conclusion

In short, to achieve
a truly “online HPC inference at input time,” with dynamic “surprise-based”
memory on the hypersphere, the TitanMemoryServer and TitanMemoryModel must call
into the HPC pipeline (HypersphereTokenFlow / HPCFlowManager) for every new chunk
of data. You currently have code for both HPC and Titan MLP, but they are never
woven together—nor are HPC’s advanced forgetting or chunk-based normalizations
actually used.

Bridging them will
require:

Revisiting the Titan
memory logic to incorporate HPC chunking, “shock absorber,” and
“preserveDiversity.”

Integrating HPC at
the server layer so that each user call can pass through HPC methods.

Adjusting the
“surprise” and “forget” so it uses HPC momentum or “shock threshold,” rather
than a single scalar gate.

With these changes,
you can achieve a cohesive system that does test-time HPC updates, has advanced
“surprise-based forgetting,” and normalizes on the hypersphere as described in
your whitepapers.
