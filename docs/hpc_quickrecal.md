# HPC-QuickRecal: Advanced Memory Prioritization Framework

## Overview

HPC-QuickRecal (HPC-QR) represents a fundamental shift from traditional significance-based memory systems toward a unified, geometry-aware approach for memory prioritization. This document outlines the mathematical foundations, implementation details, and integration strategies for the HPC-QR framework.

## From Significance to QuickRecal

Traditional memory systems often rely on simplistic "significance" metrics that primarily weight surprise or magnitude terms. HPC-QuickRecal moves beyond this approach by integrating multiple cognitive factors into a unified equation that more accurately reflects human-like memory prioritization.

### The HPC-QR Equation

The core of the system is the HPC-QR function that blends multiple factors into a single scoring metric:

```
HPC_QR(x) = α·R_geom(x) + β·C_novel(x) + γ·S_org(x) - δ·O_red(x)
```

Where:

- **R_geom(x)**: Geometry-Aware Distance - how "far" in a Riemannian or mixed curvature sense the new embedding x is from existing memory buffers (momentum, prototypes, etc.)
  
- **C_novel(x)**: Causal/Contextual Novelty - a measure of novel cause-effect content or unusual correlation relative to known causal graphs
  
- **S_org(x)**: Self-Organization Divergence - how strongly x prompts reconfiguration of the network's internal SOM-like or meta-learned topology
  
- **O_red(x)**: Redundancy/Overlap - how much x is already explained by the memory buffer (subtracted to penalize repetitive content)

- **α, β, γ, δ**: Tunable weights that balance the contribution of each factor

### Mathematical Foundations

#### Geometric Distance (R_geom)

R_geom can be computed via multiple approaches depending on the embedding space:

- **Hyperbolic Distance**: For hierarchical data in a hyperbolic space
  ```
  d_κ(x,c) = (2/√|κ|)·arcsinh(√|κ|·‖x-c‖/2)
  ```
  where κ is a learnable curvature parameter

- **Spherical Distance**: For normalized embeddings on a unit hypersphere
  
- **Adaptive Curvature**: A metric learned end-to-end based on data characteristics

#### Causal Novelty (C_novel)

C_novel measures how surprising an embedding is under causal priors:

- How much the embedding would update a learned causal graph
- Surprise under a Bayesian causal model
- Divergence from expected causal chains

#### Self-Organization (S_org)

S_org quantifies the adaptation required to integrate new information:

- Energy required by self-organizing maps to incorporate new data
- Gradient magnitude in meta-learning systems
- Topology reconfiguration metrics

#### Redundancy Penalty (O_red)

O_red prevents storing repetitive information:

- Cosine similarity with existing memory items
- Manifold proximity measures
- Information-theoretic overlap metrics

## Implementation

The HPC-QR framework is implemented through the `HPCQRFlowManager` class, which handles asynchronous processing of embeddings and computation of QuickRecal scores.

### Core Components

1. **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Handles embedding normalization, dimension adjustment, and projection to the appropriate manifold

2. **HPC-QR Calculation**: Implements the unified equation to produce a single scalar score

3. **Momentum Management**: Maintains reference vectors for comparison and recent history

4. **Asynchronous Processing**: Enables efficient parallel computation of QuickRecal scores

### Key Methods

- `process_embedding(embedding)`: Main entry point for processing new embeddings
  
- `_compute_hpc_qr(embedding)`: Core function that calculates the QuickRecal score
  
- `_preprocess_embedding(embedding)`: Handles dimension alignment and normalization
  
- `_align_vectors_for_comparison(v1, v2)`: Ensures vectors are compatible for comparison operations

## Integration with Advanced Architecture

The modular design of HPC-QR allows for sophisticated extensions:

### Riemannian Geometry

Replace simple Euclidean distances with specialized metrics:

- Hyperbolic distance for hierarchical data
- Spherical distance for directional data
- Mixed-curvature manifolds for complex relationships

### Causal AI Integration

Enhance C_novel with advanced causal reasoning:

- Bayesian causal measures for embedding evaluation
- Causal graph updates as novelty indicators
- Counterfactual reasoning for surprise quantification

### Self-Organizing Maps

Implement S_org using actual self-organizing processes:

- Neural gas or Growing Neural Gas adaptations
- Gradient-based reorganization metrics
- Topology preservation measures

### Mechanistic Interpretability

Augment HPC-QR with explanation capabilities:

- Adjust scores based on explanation gaps
- Reward embeddings with clear causal interpretations
- Penalize difficult-to-explain patterns

## Advantages Over Significance-Based Approaches

1. **Unified Framework**: Single scalar score that integrates multiple cognitive factors

2. **Computational Efficiency**: Single-pass computation and asynchronous-friendly design

3. **Reduced Overhead**: Consolidates multiple threshold checks into one comprehensive evaluation

4. **Geometric Awareness**: Properly handles curved embedding spaces and manifold structures

5. **Causal Integration**: Incorporates cause-effect relationships into memory prioritization

6. **Adaptivity**: Self-organization metrics enable the system to evolve with incoming data

7. **Redundancy Control**: Explicitly penalizes repetitive information

## Practical Implementation Notes

### Configuration

The HPC-QR system uses a configuration dictionary with these key parameters:

- `chunk_size`: Embedding dimension (e.g., 384 or 768)
- `alpha`, `beta`, `gamma`, `delta`: Weighting factors for the HPC-QR equation
- Processing parameters: `max_threads`, `retry_attempts`, etc.

### Dimension Handling

The system handles embeddings of different dimensions (e.g., 384 vs. 768) through:

- Padding smaller vectors with zeros
- Truncating larger vectors to match the expected dimension
- Dynamically aligning vectors for comparison operations

### Error Handling

Robust error management includes:

- Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- Detailed error statistics and logging
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

## Tuning and Optimization

For optimal performance, consider:

1. **Weight Calibration**: Tune α, β, γ, δ based on your specific domain

2. **Meta-Optimization**: Allow the system to learn optimal coefficients

3. **Geometric Adaptation**: Adjust manifold parameters (like curvature) to match data structure

4. **Asynchronous Processing**: Configure thread pools and timeouts for your hardware

## Multi-Modal Extensions

The HPC-QR approach naturally extends to:

- Text embeddings from different models
- Image representations
- Audio features
- Multi-modal fusion embeddings

Provided that consistent embedding spaces are maintained or appropriate transformations are applied.

## Conclusion

HPC-QuickRecal represents a significant advancement over traditional significance-based memory systems. By unifying geometric, causal, self-organizing, and redundancy factors into a single coherent framework, it provides more human-like memory prioritization while maintaining computational efficiency and scalability.
