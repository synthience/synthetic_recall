# Synthians Cognitive Architecture Overview

*(Existing Introduction - Keep as is)*

## System Principles

*   Memory is weighted (QuickRecal).
*   Emotion shapes recall (Emotional Gating).
*   Surprise signals significance (NM â†’ QR Boost).
*   Ideas cluster and connect (Assemblies).
*   Presence emerges from adaptive memory (NM Learning + Variant Selection).
*   **Cognition should be explainable (Planned for Phase 5.9: Introspection Layer).**

## High-Level Components (Current & Planned)

1.  **Synthians Memory Core (MC):** The stable archive. Manages `MemoryEntry` and `MemoryAssembly` persistence, vector indexing (FAISS), QuickRecall scoring, emotional context. **Planned for Phase 5.9: Expose diagnostic and explainability data via new APIs.**
2.  **Neural Memory Server (NM):** The adaptive associator. Implements test-time learning (Titans-based) on embedding sequences, calculates surprise metrics. Configuration planned to be exposed via MC API (`/config/runtime/neural-memory`).
3.  **Context Cascade Engine (CCE):** The orchestrator. Manages MC<->NM flow, dynamic variant selection, LLM guidance integration. **Planned for Phase 5.9: Enhanced metrics reporting (`/metrics/recent_cce_responses`) for dashboard consumption.** Configuration may be exposed via MC API (`/config/runtime/cce`).
4.  **Explainability & Diagnostics Backend (Planned New Layer - Part of MC):** Internal logic (`explainability/`) and persistent logs (`metrics/`) providing data for API endpoints that reveal system behavior (merge events, activations, lineage).
5.  **Synthians Cognitive Dashboard (Planned for Phase 5.9.1 - Frontend):** The visualization and interaction layer. Will consume APIs from MC, NM, CCE to display system state, metrics, and explanations. *(Specification in `docs/guides/DASHBOARD_SPECIFICATION.md`)*

### Planned for Phase 5.9: Introspection Layer

Phase 5.9 will introduce a dedicated backend layer within the Memory Core focused on making the system's internal operations observable and explainable. This will involve:
*   **Capturing Key Events:** Logging significant events like assembly merges with relevant context (similarity scores, source IDs) via `MergeTracker`.
*   **Persisting Lineage:** Storing the `merged_from` history directly within `MemoryAssembly` objects (already implemented in the data structure).
*   **Calculating Explanations:** Implementing logic within the `explainability/` module to re-evaluate or retrieve data that explains *why* an activation occurred (similarity vs. threshold) or *how* a merge happened (source assemblies, similarity).
*   **Exposing Diagnostics:** Providing API endpoints to query merge history (`/diagnostics/merge_log`), runtime configuration (`/config/runtime/*`), and basic performance metrics (like assembly activation in `/stats`).
*   **Enabling Dashboard Integration:** Creating the necessary API surface for a dedicated monitoring and visualization dashboard.

## Memory Assemblies (Current & Planned)

Memory Assemblies (`MemoryAssembly`) represent dynamically formed groups of related `MemoryEntry` objects.
*   They possess a `composite_embedding` (semantic center).
*   **Phase 5.8 (Current):** Stability improved with `vector_index_updated_at` timestamp tracking synchronization with the vector index. Only synchronized assemblies contribute to retrieval boosting. Failed index updates are queued for retry.
*   **Phase 5.9 (Planned):** Will add full utilization of the existing `merged_from: List[str]` field to track merge ancestry. Merge events will be logged persistently via `MergeTracker` to `merge_log.jsonl`.
