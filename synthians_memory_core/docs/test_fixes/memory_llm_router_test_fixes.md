# MemoryLLMRouter Test Fixes

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to fix the test implementation for the `MemoryLLMRouter` class, specifically addressing issues with test fixtures, mock response structures, and error handling assertions.

## Key Changes

### 1. Fixed Constructor Parameter Alignment

The test fixtures were updated to use the correct constructor parameters for the `MemoryLLMRouter` class:

- Used `mode` instead of `disabled`
- Used `llama_endpoint` instead of `api_endpoint`
- Used `llama_model` instead of `model_name`
- Used `retry_attempts` instead of `max_retries`
- Used `timeout` directly instead of conflating with other parameters

### 2. Corrected Mock Response Structures

The mock API responses were updated to better represent the actual LM Studio API response format:

- Ensured the proper context manager behavior with `__aenter__` returning the response object
- Correctly structured the response JSON with `choices[0].message.content` containing the serialized advice
- Configured the return values to match the expected schema format

### 3. Added Custom Mock Exception Class

Created a `MockClientError` class to avoid issues with aiohttp's `ClientConnectorError` when it's used in string formatting during error handling:

```python
class MockClientError(Exception):
    """Mock client error that doesn't break when stringified in error handling"""
    def __init__(self, message):
        self.message = message
        super().__init__(message)
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f"Mock Client Error: {self.message}"
```

This prevents the `AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'ssl'` error that was occurring when the router tried to log the error message.

### 4. Improved Session Management Test

Enhanced the session management test by:

- Creating two distinct mock instances instead of reusing the same mock
- Setting up side effects to return different mocks on consecutive calls
- Properly verifying session reuse and recreation after closure

### 5. Updated Assertions for Error Messages

Adjusted the assertions in error handling tests to match the actual format of error messages returned by the router:

- Used more flexible assertions that check for key parts of messages instead of exact matches
- Updated the `test_json_error_handling` to check for "Invalid JSON" in the notes instead of "JSON parse error"

## Testing Strategy

The tests cover these key aspects of the `MemoryLLMRouter`:

1. **Basic functionality**: Initialization, disabled mode
2. **Successful API calls**: Proper payload formatting and response parsing
3. **Error handling**: Connection errors, timeouts, JSON parse errors
4. **Response validation**: Schema validation, missing content detection
5. **Session management**: Creation, reuse, and proper closure of aiohttp sessions
6. **Retry logic**: Multiple retry attempts with different error types

## Conclusion

These fixes ensure that the tests for the `MemoryLLMRouter` correctly validate the component's behavior while properly mocking external dependencies. The improved tests provide better coverage and will catch regressions more reliably.
