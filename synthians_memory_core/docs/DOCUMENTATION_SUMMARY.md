### Dashboard

- [Dashboard Specification](./guides/DASHBOARD_SPECIFICATION.md): Requirements for the Synthians Cognitive Dashboard.

## Key Stability Features (Phase 5.8)

Phase 5.8 introduced several critical stability improvements:

1. **Drift-Aware Gating**: The `vector_index_updated_at` timestamp on `MemoryAssembly` objects ensures that only synchronized assemblies contribute to retrieval boosting. This prevents using stale embeddings and improves system stability.

2. **Vector Index Retry Mechanism**: Failed vector index operations are queued in `_pending_vector_updates` and processed by the `_vector_update_retry_loop` background task. This provides resilience against temporary FAISS failures.

3. **Robust Persistence**: The system uses atomic file operations with temporary files and proper flushing to ensure data integrity, even during crashes.

4. **Concurrency Management**: The Memory Core uses `asyncio.Lock` to protect critical sections, avoiding race conditions in data structures.

5. **Index Integrity Checking**: The system validates index consistency on startup and can repair inconsistencies between the vector index and stored memory objects.

## Planned Enhancements (Phase 5.9)

Phase 5.9 will focus on the following key areas:

1. **Explainability**: Providing insights into why assemblies are activated or merged, tracing assembly lineage, and exposing decision factors.

2. **Diagnostics**: Tracking merge operations, exposing runtime configuration, and collecting activation statistics for analysis.

3. **Dashboard Integration**: Creating APIs to support the Synthians Cognitive Dashboard for real-time monitoring and visualization.

## Best Practices for Developers

1. **Background Tasks**: Be aware of the background tasks (`_persistence_loop`, `_vector_update_retry_loop`, `_decay_and_pruning_loop`) and their roles in maintaining system stability.

2. **Assembly Management**: Always respect the drift-aware gating mechanism by checking `vector_index_updated_at` before using assemblies for boosting.

3. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for vector operations, as FAISS operations can fail, especially with GPU acceleration.

4. **Concurrency**: Use appropriate locking mechanisms when modifying shared data structures.

5. **Testing**: Follow the comprehensive testing strategy for new features to ensure stability and performance.

## Documentation Improvements

Recent documentation improvements include:

1. **Enhanced Core Internals**: Added detailed explanations of background tasks, concurrency mechanisms, and recovery procedures.

2. **Clarified GPU Limitations**: Explicitly documented that FAISS `IndexIDMap` operations execute on CPU even with GPU enabled.

3. **Emphasized Drift-Aware Gating**: Added clear explanations of the critical role of `vector_index_updated_at` in system stability.

4. **Detailed API Models**: Created comprehensive specifications for Phase 5.9 API endpoints to ensure consistent implementation.

5. **Implementation Guidance**: Added specific guidance for implementing the explainability and diagnostics features, including dependencies and performance considerations.
