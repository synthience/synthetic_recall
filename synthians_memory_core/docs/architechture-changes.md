# Synthians Cognitive Architecture: Architecture Change Log

This document logs significant architectural decisions and changes to the Synthians Cognitive Architecture.

## Planned for Phase 5.9: Explainability Layer (April 2025)

**Category**: Major Enhancement

**Summary**: The Phase 5.9 update will add a comprehensive explainability layer to provide insights into the system's internal decision-making processes.

**Key Changes (Planned)**:
- Creation of dedicated explainability modules for tracking and explaining system decisions
- Implementation of APIs for retrieving explanations of assembly activations and merges
- Addition of persistent merge logging and lineage tracking
- Full utilization of the `merged_from` field in `MemoryAssembly` objects
- Runtime configuration exposure via sanitized endpoints
- Enhanced metrics for assembly activation statistics

This layer will consist of:
- An `explainability/` module with explanation logic
- A `metrics/` module with `MergeTracker` and activation stats
- New API endpoints for accessing explanations and diagnostics
- Persistent logging in JSONL format

## Phase 5.8: Vector Index Stability and Drift Awareness (March 2025)

**Category**: Major Enhancement

**Summary**: Extended the memory assembly system with drift detection and stabilization mechanisms.

**Key Changes**:
- Added timestamp tracking (`vector_index_updated_at`) for assemblies in the FAISS index
- Implemented "drift-aware gating" to only boost assemblies with up-to-date vector representation
- Created assembly_sync_manager for managing index synchronization
- Added pending update queue with automatic retry for failed vector operations
- Enhanced `/stats` endpoint with sync status metrics
- Added detailed index diagnostics and repair functionality

**Architecture Impact**:
- More robust memory assembly activation based on synchronization status
- Graceful handling of FAISS/GPU failures
- Self-healing system through automated and manual repair pathways

## Phase 5.7: Neural Memory and CCE Integration (January 2025)

**Category**: Integration

**Summary**: Improved integration between Memory Core, Neural Memory, and Context Cascade Engine.

**Key Changes**:
- Enhanced API endpoints for cross-component communication
- Standardized error handling
- Added consistent metrics reporting
- Implemented surprise feedback loop from Neural Memory to Memory Core

**Architecture Impact**:
- More coherent orchestration of memory operations
- Clear separation of responsibilities between components
- Enhanced cognitive feedback loops

## Phase 5.5-5.6: Adaptive Component Selection (November 2024)

**Category**: Major Enhancement

**Summary**: Added dynamic variant selection based on performance metrics.

**Key Changes**:
- Implemented performance-aware variant selection
- Added LLM guidance integration for variant hints
- Standardized trace logging across components
- Added weighted attention mechanisms based on context

**Architecture Impact**:
- System adapts processing strategy based on content and context
- Cognitive flow becomes dynamic rather than static
- External LLM can provide hints for processing approach

## Phase 5.0-5.4: Titans Cognitive Variants (August-October 2024)

**Category**: Major Feature

**Summary**: Implemented the initial Bi-Hemispheric model with multiple processing variants.

**Key Changes**:
- Created MAC variant (Memory-Attention-Compression)
- Created MAG variant (Memory-Attention-Gates) 
- Created MAL variant (Memory-Attention-Learning)
- Initial implementation of the Context Cascade Engine
- Basic metrics collection and reporting

**Architecture Impact**:
- Fundamental shift from single-path to multi-path processing
- Addition of adaptive components based on content type
- Introduction of the orchestration layer (CCE)
