# Vector Index Update Functionality Fix

## Overview

This document details the resolution of memory update errors that were causing critical failures in the Context Cascade Engine (CCE). The fix focuses on implementing proper vector updating functionality in the FAISS index integration.

## Issue

The QuickRecal updates were consistently failing with the error:

```
Memory Core storage failed: None
```

Root cause analysis revealed:

1. When CCE attempted to update memory QuickRecal scores, it called `memory_core.update_memory`
2. This method attempted to call `vector_index.update_entry` on the memory's embedding
3. The `update_entry` method was missing from the `MemoryVectorIndex` class, causing an AttributeError
4. This failure left the memory system in an inconsistent state, causing subsequent operations to fail

## Solution

1. Implemented the missing `update_entry` method in `vector_index.py` with the following features:
   - Full support for FAISS `IndexIDMap` updating via remove+add pattern
   - Proper validation of input embeddings before updating
   - Graceful handling when the numeric ID is not found in the index
   - Fallback to remove+add pattern for compatibility with different index types

2. Added a complementary `remove_vector` method to support the update operations:
   - Proper handling of ID mappings during removal
   - Cleanup of the ID mapping dictionary when vectors are removed
   - Automatic backup of ID mappings after successful removal
   - Handling of edge cases where the ID exists in the mapping but not in the FAISS index

3. Enhanced error handling and logging:
   - Added detailed logging to help diagnose future issues
   - Implemented proper exception handling throughout both methods
   - Added graceful degradation paths for unsupported index types

## Related Issues

This fix complements our previous vector alignment and embedding validation improvements by ensuring the vector index can be properly maintained throughout the memory lifecycle. It addresses a critical gap in the memory update flow that was preventing the successful updating of QuickRecal scores.

## Testing

The fix was validated by confirming:

1. QuickRecal score updates now complete successfully
2. Memory processing no longer fails with "Memory Core storage failed: None" errors
3. The vector index stays consistent across multiple updates
4. Both add and update operations properly validate and normalize embeddings

## Future Improvements

1. Consider adding index integrity checks after update operations
2. Implement batch update capabilities for multiple vector updates
3. Add more efficient vector update strategies for specific FAISS index types
4. Create comprehensive unit tests for vector index update flows
