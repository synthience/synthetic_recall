# LLM Connectivity and Dashboard Fixes (Phase 5.6)

## Overview

This document details the successful resolution of LLM connectivity issues and dashboard display errors in the Phase 5.6 implementation. These fixes ensure proper communication between the Synthians cognitive system and the LLM guidance service.

## LLM Connectivity Fixes

### Issue 1: Docker Network Connectivity
The system was unable to connect to the LLM service because it was using hardcoded localhost/127.0.0.1 URLs, which don't work properly in Docker containers.

### Solution 1
1. Updated the LLM endpoint URLs in multiple components to use `host.docker.internal` instead of `127.0.0.1`:
   - `memory_logic_proxy.py`: Updated default `llama_endpoint` parameter
   - `context_cascade_engine.py`: Updated default `llm_studio_endpoint` parameter
   - `docker-compose.yml`: Updated `LLM_STUDIO_ENDPOINT` environment variable

2. Added proper Docker networking configuration:
   - Ensured `extra_hosts` configuration in docker-compose.yml includes `host.docker.internal:host-gateway`

3. Added enhanced logging to diagnose connection issues:
   - Added environment variable logging in `memory_logic_proxy.py` to verify which endpoint is being used

### Issue 2: LLM API Payload Structure
After resolving the network connectivity issue, we encountered API errors with requests to the LLM service:
```
ERROR - synthians_memory_core.orchestrator.memory_logic_proxy - LLM API error (status 400): {"error":"'response_format.json_schema.schema' must be an object"}
```

### Solution 2
1. Modified the JSON schema payload structure in `memory_logic_proxy.py` to match the expected format:
   - Fixed the `response_format` structure in the API payload
   - Properly nested the JSON schema under a `schema` key within the `json_schema` object
   - Before:
     ```python
     "response_format": {
         "type": "json_schema", 
         "json_schema": self.DEFAULT_LLM_SCHEMA["schema"]
     }
     ```
   - After:
     ```python
     "response_format": {
         "type": "json_schema", 
         "json_schema": {
             "schema": self.DEFAULT_LLM_SCHEMA["schema"]
         }
     }
     ```

2. This change aligned our API request structure with the LLM API's expectations for JSON schema validation

## Dashboard Error Fixes

### Issue 1: Dashboard Formatting Errors
The variant diagnostics dashboard was encountering formatting errors with the error: "unsupported format string passed to NoneType.__format__" when attempting to display performance metrics with `None` values.

### Solution 
1. Fixed string formatting in `variant_diagnostics_dashboard.py` to handle `None` values properly:
   - Added type checking with `isinstance(value, (int, float))` before applying float format specifiers
   - Implemented safe formatting for numerical values throughout the dashboard
   - Added fallbacks to handle non-numeric values gracefully

2. Key sections fixed:
   - Performance metrics panel
   - LLM guidance panel
   - Adaptive attention panel 
   - Variant statistics panel

## Testing and Verification

The fixes were validated by running tests with repeated memory processing requests. The tests confirmed:

1. Successful LLM connectivity with host.docker.internal addressing
2. Proper API payload structure accepted by the LLM service
3. Proper diagnostic dashboard display without formatting errors
4. Consistent variant selection based on performance metrics
5. Expected loss/grad_norm values showing decreasing trends with repeated inputs

## Next Steps

- Continue monitoring the system for any remaining connectivity issues
- Further enhance dashboard UI to better visualize performance-aware variant selection
- Consider adding more detailed logging around LLM API calls for troubleshooting
- Update unit and integration tests to ensure connectivity issues don't resurface

**Note**: When deploying in different environments, ensure the LLM endpoint is properly configured for the specific network setup. Using `host.docker.internal` is the correct approach for connecting Docker containers to services running on the host machine.
