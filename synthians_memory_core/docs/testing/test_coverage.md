   - Added tests for zero vector substitution for invalid embeddings

3. **Metadata Enrichment Tests**:
   - Added tests for memory UUID in metadata
   - Added tests for content length tracking

## Priority Testing Gaps

### High Priority

1. **Titans Variant Integration Tests**:
   - Need dedicated tests for MAC, MAG, MAL effects
   - Need tests across service boundaries with these variants enabled
   - Need performance comparison tests

2. **Surprise Feedback Loop**:
   - Need comprehensive end-to-end tests of the boost mechanism
   - Need tests with varying surprise levels and expected QuickRecal boosts

3. **Embedding Dimension Handling**:
   - Need more extensive tests for mixed dimension handling throughout the system
   - Need stress tests with rapidly alternating dimensions

### Medium Priority

1. **Outer Loop Training**:
   - Tests for the Neural Memory's `/train_outer` endpoint
   - Tests for projection weight optimization

2. **MetricsStore**:
   - Tests for metrics aggregation and analysis
   - Tests for alert threshold detection

3. **Error Recovery**:
   - Tests for system behavior when one service fails
   - Tests for recovery mechanisms

### Low Priority

1. **Performance Benchmarks**:
   - Standard test suite for performance comparison across releases
   - Memory usage tracking tests

2. **Configuration Testing**:
   - Tests for all configuration parameters and combinations
   - Tests for environment variable overrides

## Test Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Critical Path Coverage (Completed)

- Ensure all basic functionality has test coverage
- Focus on recent bug fixes having tests
- Establish basic integration test fixtures

### Phase 2: Variant Integration Tests (Current)

- Develop comprehensive tests for MAC, MAG, MAL variants
- Test surprise feedback loop end-to-end
- Test embedding dimension handling across service boundaries

### Phase 3: Edge Cases & Recovery (Next)

- Add tests for error conditions and recovery
- Stress tests for concurrent operations
- Boundary condition tests

### Phase 4: Performance & Benchmarking (Planned)

- Establish standard performance tests
- Create memory and CPU usage benchmarks
- Measure cognitive cycle latency under various conditions

## Test Coverage Tools and Reporting

### Code Coverage Tools

```python
# Install coverage tools
pip install pytest-cov

# Run tests with coverage reporting
pytest --cov=synthians_memory_core --cov=orchestrator --cov-report=html tests/

# Generate HTML report
# Report will be available in htmlcov/ directory
```

### Coverage Report Interpretation

The coverage report includes several key metrics:

1. **Statement Coverage**: Percentage of code statements executed during testing
2. **Branch Coverage**: Percentage of conditional branches (if/else) executed
3. **Path Coverage**: Percentage of possible execution paths tested

Code with high statement coverage but low branch/path coverage may indicate insufficient edge case testing.

### Continuous Integration Coverage

Our CI pipeline runs coverage analysis on each pull request and enforces:

- Minimum 80% statement coverage for new code
- No decrease in overall coverage
- Coverage reports uploaded as artifacts

## Mutation Testing

In addition to standard coverage, we employ mutation testing to evaluate test quality:

```python
# Install mutation testing tool
pip install pytest-mutate

# Run mutation tests on a specific module
pytest-mutate synthians_memory_core/core/memory_core.py
```

Mutation testing makes small modifications to the code ("mutants") and checks if tests detect the change. A high mutant kill rate indicates robust tests.

## Best Practices for Test Development

1. **Prioritize Critical Paths**: Focus on the most important functionalities first
2. **Test Edge Cases**: Include boundary conditions and error cases
3. **Isolate Tests**: Each test should be independent and deterministic
4. **Mock Dependencies**: Use mocks for external services to isolate test scope
5. **Test Real-World Scenarios**: Include tests that reflect actual usage patterns
6. **Keep Tests Fast**: Optimize slow tests to maintain developer productivity
7. **Parameterize Similar Tests**: Use parameterization for testing similar scenarios
8. **Document Test Purpose**: Include clear docstrings explaining what each test verifies

## Test Skip Policies

Tests may be skipped under specific conditions:

```python
@pytest.mark.skipif(os.environ.get("SKIP_SLOW_TESTS") == "1", reason="Slow test")
def test_large_dataset_processing():
    # Test implementation
    pass
```

Valid reasons for skipping tests:
- Environment-specific tests not applicable to all setups
- Very slow tests during rapid development cycles
- Tests for features behind feature flags

All skipped tests must have a clear explanation and should be periodically reviewed.
