## Development Roadmap & Status (March 28, 2025)

**Project:** Synthians Cognitive Architecture (Lucidia)  
**Focus:** Bi-Hemispheric Memory System (Memory Core + Neural Memory)  
**Status:** Full Cognitive Cycle Operational

**Overall Goal:** Implement a robust, unified memory system enabling adaptive, long-context cognition inspired by human memory and the Titans paper. Create the infrastructure for a persistent, learning cognitive presence (Lucidia).

    *   Emotional context preservation throughout processing.
    *   Cognitive diagnostics surface layer implemented (alerts, recommendations).
    *   Performance improvements (processing time reduced from ~4900ms to ~650ms).
*   **Critical Fixes (March 2025):**
    *   Added `get_memory_by_id` method to SynthiansMemoryCore.
    *   Implemented `update_memory` method for quickrecal score updates.
    *   Fixed Neural Memory dimension mismatches with adaptive validation.

### Phase 4: Meta-Attentional Systems (Planned)

*   **Objective:** Implement and evaluate the different ways of integrating the Neural Memory with Attention, as described in Section 4 of the Titans paper (MAC, MAG, MAL).
*   **Status:** **TODO**
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Design Keras/TF layers implementing the specific attention/gating mechanisms for MAC, MAG, MAL.
    *   Integrate these layers with the `NeuralMemoryModule` and `MemoryCore` (likely within or called by the `ContextCascadeEngine`).
    *   Benchmark the different approaches on various cognitive tasks.
    *   Implement meta-learning for adaptive attention mechanism selection.

*   **Objective:** Enable Lucidia to explain her cognitive processes and decision-making.
*   **Status:** **TODO**
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Implement memory trace analysis for decision pathways.
    *   Create narrative generation for cognitive processes.
    *   Develop visualization tools for memory activations.
    *   Add explainability metrics and feedback mechanisms.

## Full Cognitive Cycle

Lucidia now implements a complete cognitive cycle connecting all components in a bi-directional feedback loop:

1. **Memory Ingestion**
   - New content/embedding received by Memory Core
   - Metadata synthesized and QuickRecal score initialized
   - Memory stored with ID in MemoryCore and Vector Index

2. **Neural Memory Update**
   - Memory embedding sent to Neural Memory module
   - Test-time learning via gradient updates occurs
   - Current memory state (M_t) updated with new association
   - Surprise metrics (loss, gradient norm) calculated

3. **Surprise Integration**
   - Surprise metrics sent back to Memory Core
   - QuickRecal score dynamically boosted based on surprise
   - Memory importance adjusted to reflect cognitive significance

4. **Memory Retrieval**
   - Query embedding sent to Neural Memory for association retrieval
   - Retrieved embedding combined with Vector Index results
   - Emotional gating applied based on current context
   - Most relevant memories returned with confidence scores

5. **Cognitive Diagnostics**
   - System-wide metrics tracked and analyzed
   - Alerts generated for anomalies (high loss, gradient issues)
   - Recommendations provided for parameter tuning
   - Emotional diversity and bias measured

This cycle operates continuously, allowing Lucidia to adapt, learn from surprises, remember what's important, and retrieve memories based on both semantic similarity and learned associations.
