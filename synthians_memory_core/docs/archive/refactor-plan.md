## **Unified Memory System: Technical Overview & Roadmap (Synthians Core)**

**Goal:** Consolidate the complex memory codebase into a single, efficient, unified system (`synthians_memory_core`) running locally (e.g., on an RTX 4090 via Docker), focusing on core memory operations, HPC-QuickRecal scoring, emotional context, and memory assemblies for an MVP by the end of the week.

---

### 1. **Technical Overview of the Unified `synthians_memory_core`**

This unified system centralizes memory functionality, integrating the most valuable and innovative concepts identified previously, while simplifying the architecture for clarity and maintainability.

**Core Components (Target Architecture):**

1.  **`SynthiansMemoryCore` (`synthians_memory_core.py`):**
    *   **Role:** The central orchestrator and main API endpoint.
    *   **Responsibilities:** Initializes and manages all other core components. Handles incoming requests for storing (`process_new_memory`) and retrieving (`retrieve_memories`) memories. Manages the in-memory cache/working set (`self.memories`), memory assemblies (`self.assemblies`), and coordinates background tasks. Delegates specialized tasks (scoring, geometry, persistence, emotion) to dedicated managers. Provides LLM tool interfaces (`get_tools`, `handle_tool_call`).
2.  **`UnifiedQuickRecallCalculator` (`hpc_quickrecal.py`):**
    *   **Role:** The single source of truth for calculating memory importance (`quickrecal_score`).
    *   **Responsibilities:** Implements various scoring modes (Standard, HPC-QR, Minimal, etc.) using configurable factor weights. Calculates factors like Recency, Emotion, Relevance, Importance, Personal, and potentially simplified versions of HPC-QR factors (Geometry, Novelty, Self-Org, Overlap) using the `GeometryManager`.
3.  **`GeometryManager` (`geometry_manager.py`):**
    *   **Role:** Central authority for all embedding geometry operations.
    *   **Responsibilities:** Validates embeddings (NaN/Inf checks). Normalizes vectors. Aligns vectors of different dimensions (e.g., 384 vs 768). Performs geometric transformations (e.g., Euclidean to Hyperbolic via `_to_hyperbolic`). Calculates distances and similarities based on the configured geometry (Euclidean, Hyperbolic, Spherical, Mixed).
4.  **`EmotionalAnalyzer` & `EmotionalGatingService` (`emotional_intelligence.py`):**
    *   **Role:** Handle emotional context.
    *   **Responsibilities:** `EmotionalAnalyzer` (simplified/placeholder for now) provides emotional analysis of text. `EmotionalGatingService` uses this analysis and user state to filter/re-rank retrieved memories, implementing cognitive defense and resonance scoring.
5.  **`MemoryPersistence` (`memory_persistence.py`):**
    *   **Role:** Sole handler for all disk-based memory operations.
    *   **Responsibilities:** Asynchronously saves (`save_memory`), loads (`load_memory`), and deletes (`delete_memory`) `MemoryEntry` objects using atomic writes (temp files + rename) and JSON format. Manages a memory index file (`memory_index.json`) and handles backups.
6.  **`MemoryEntry` & `MemoryAssembly` (`memory_structures.py`):**
    *   **Role:** Standard data structures.
    *   **Responsibilities:** `MemoryEntry` defines a single memory unit with content, embedding (standard and optional hyperbolic), QuickRecal score, and metadata. `MemoryAssembly` groups related `MemoryEntry` IDs, maintains a composite embedding (using `GeometryManager`), tracks activation, and handles emotional profiles/keywords for the group.
7.  **`ThresholdCalibrator` (`adaptive_components.py`):**
    *   **Role:** Enables adaptive retrieval relevance.
    *   **Responsibilities:** Dynamically adjusts the similarity threshold used in `retrieve_memories` based on feedback (`provide_feedback`) about whether retrieved memories were actually relevant.
8.  **`custom_logger.py`:**
    *   **Role:** Provides a consistent logging interface used by all components.

**Key Workflows in Unified System:**

*   **Memory Storage:**
    1.  `SynthiansMemoryCore.process_new_memory` receives content/embedding/metadata.
    2.  It calls `GeometryManager` to validate, align, and normalize the embedding.
    3.  It calls `UnifiedQuickRecallCalculator.calculate` to get the `quickrecal_score`.
    4.  It calls `EmotionalAnalyzer.analyze` to get emotional context for metadata.
    5.  If geometry is hyperbolic, it calls `GeometryManager._to_hyperbolic`.
    6.  It creates a `MemoryEntry`.
    7.  If score > threshold, it stores the `MemoryEntry` in `self.memories`.
    8.  It asynchronously calls `MemoryPersistence.save_memory`.
    9.  It calls `_update_assemblies` to potentially add the memory to relevant `MemoryAssembly` objects.
*   **Memory Retrieval:**
    1.  `SynthiansMemoryCore.retrieve_memories` receives query/embedding/context.
    2.  It calls `GeometryManager` to validate/align/normalize the query embedding.
    3.  It calls `_get_candidate_memories` which:
        *   Activates relevant `MemoryAssembly` objects based on similarity (using `GeometryManager.calculate_similarity`).
        *   Performs a quick direct similarity search against `self.memories` (using `GeometryManager.calculate_similarity`).
        *   Returns a combined list of candidate `MemoryEntry` objects.
    4.  It calculates relevance scores for candidates (using `GeometryManager.calculate_similarity`).
    5.  It calls `EmotionalGatingService.gate_memories` to filter/re-rank based on user emotion.
    6.  If `ThresholdCalibrator` is enabled, it filters results based on the current dynamic threshold.
    7.  Returns the top K results as dictionaries.

**Simplifications for MVP:**

*   **No Distributed Architecture:** Assumes a single process/container. `MemoryBroker` and `MemoryClientProxy` are removed.
*   **No Full Self/World Models:** The complex `SelfModel` and `WorldModel` classes are excluded. Basic context can be simulated or derived directly from memory/KG if needed later.
*   **No Advanced Dreaming/Narrative:** The `DreamProcessor`, `DreamManager`, `ReflectionEngine`, and `NarrativeIdentity` system are deferred. Dream insights could be stored as simple `MemoryEntry` objects if needed.
*   **Simplified Knowledge Graph:** The full modular KG is deferred. Core storage uses the `MemoryPersistence` layer. If basic graph features are needed *immediately*, use the `CoreGraphManager` directly, but avoid the full modular complexity for the MVP.
*   **Single Server:** Combines API endpoints into one server (`synthians_server.py`) using FastAPI. No separate Tensor/HPC servers needed locally; embedding/scoring happens within the `SynthiansMemoryCore` process.
*   **Simplified HPC-QR Factors:** For the MVP, `UnifiedQuickRecallCalculator` can initially focus on Recency, Relevance (Similarity), Emotion, Importance, Personal, Overlap. Geometric, Causal, and SOM factors can be added iteratively post-MVP.

### 3. **Development Roadmap for MVP (End of Week Target)**

**Goal:** A single Docker container running the unified `SynthiansMemoryCore` with basic storage, retrieval, HPC-QR scoring, emotional gating, assemblies, and adaptive thresholds.

**Assumptions:**
*   Focus is on the *memory system core*. Full Self/World model integration, Dreaming, Narrative, and complex KG are post-MVP.
*   Embedding generation is handled externally or via a placeholder within `SynthiansMemoryCore`.
*   You have a working Docker environment and Python 3.8+.

**Phase 1: Setup & Core Unification (Days 1-2)**

1.  **Directory Structure:**
    *   Create the new `synthians_memory_core` directory.
    *   Copy the proposed target files (`__init__.py`, `synthians_memory_core.py`, `hpc_quickrecal.py`, `geometry_manager.py`, `emotional_intelligence.py`, `memory_structures.py`, `memory_persistence.py`, `adaptive_components.py`, `custom_logger.py`) into it.
2.  **Dependencies:** Ensure all necessary libraries (`numpy`, `torch`, `aiofiles`) are installed (add to `requirements.txt`).
3.  **Integrate `UnifiedQuickRecallCalculator`:**
    *   Focus on `STANDARD` or `MINIMAL` mode initially for simplicity.
    *   Ensure it correctly uses `GeometryManager` for any distance/similarity calls.
    *   Implement basic versions of required factors (Recency, Relevance, Emotion, Importance, Overlap). Defer complex HPC-QR factors (Geometry, Causal, SOM) if necessary for speed, using defaults.
4.  **Integrate `GeometryManager`:**
    *   Ensure `SynthiansMemoryCore` uses it for all normalization, alignment, and similarity/distance calculations.
    *   Configure the desired default geometry (e.g., 'hyperbolic').
5.  **Integrate `MemoryPersistence`:**
    *   Ensure `SynthiansMemoryCore` uses this class *exclusively* for saving/loading memories via its async methods. Remove persistence logic from other classes.
6.  **Test Core Flow:** Write basic unit tests for `SynthiansMemoryCore.process_new_memory` and `SynthiansMemoryCore.retrieve_memories` using mock embeddings to verify the main data flow through the calculator, geometry manager, and persistence. Ensure GPU is utilized if configured and available (`torch.device`).

**Phase 2: Integrate Key Features (Days 3-4)**

1.  **Emotional Intelligence:**
    *   Wire `EmotionalAnalyzer` (even the simplified version) into `SynthiansMemoryCore`.
    *   Integrate `EmotionalGatingService` into the `retrieve_memories` flow.
    *   Test retrieval with different `user_emotion` contexts.
2.  **Memory Assemblies:**
    *   Implement the assembly creation (`_update_assemblies` triggered by `process_new_memory`) and retrieval (`_get_candidate_memories` using `_activate_assemblies`) logic within `SynthiansMemoryCore`.
    *   Assemblies should use `GeometryManager` for similarity.
    *   Test creating assemblies and retrieving memories via assembly activation.
3.  **Adaptive Thresholds:**
    *   Connect `ThresholdCalibrator` to the `retrieve_memories` results.
    *   Implement the `provide_feedback` method/endpoint to update the calibrator.
    *   Test retrieval results changing as feedback is provided.
4.  **Background Tasks:** Ensure the persistence and decay/pruning loops in `SynthiansMemoryCore` are functioning correctly using `asyncio`. Test shutdown.

**Phase 3: API Exposure & Cleanup (Day 5)**

1.  **Create FastAPI Server (`synthians_server.py`):**
    *   Create a new FastAPI app.
    *   In `startup`, initialize `SynthiansMemoryCore` (and call `initialize()`).
    *   In `shutdown`, call `SynthiansMemoryCore.shutdown()`.
    *   Expose endpoints mirroring the essential functions of `SynthiansMemoryCore`:
        *   `/process_memory` (POST)
        *   `/retrieve_memories` (POST)
        *   `/provide_feedback` (POST)
        *   `/detect_contradictions` (POST)
        *   `/health` (GET)
        *   `/stats` (GET)
        *   (Optional) Endpoints for assembly management.
2.  **Create Test Client (`synthians_client.py`):**
    *   Adapt `memory_client_example.py` to call the new FastAPI endpoints.
    *   Perform end-to-end tests: store, retrieve, feedback, check stats.
3.  **Dockerize:** Create a `Dockerfile` for the unified service. Include `requirements.txt`. Ensure the storage path is correctly mapped as a volume. Configure for GPU usage (e.g., using `nvidia-docker`).
4.  **Code Cleanup:** **Delete** all the identified redundant files from the project to avoid confusion.
5.  **Documentation:** Update the main `README.md` and the `synthians_memory_core/README.md` to reflect the new unified architecture.

**Post-MVP:**

*   Re-integrate advanced HPC-QR factors (Geometry, Causal Novelty, SOM) into `UnifiedQuickRecallCalculator`.
*   Re-introduce more sophisticated Dreaming, Narrative Identity, and Self/World Model components, ensuring they use the unified `SynthiansMemoryCore` API.
*   Re-implement the full modular Knowledge Graph system, potentially using `MemoryPersistence` for its storage backend.
*   Refine error handling and performance monitoring.
*   Consider re-introducing the `MemoryBroker` if a distributed architecture is needed later.

This roadmap focuses on creating a functional, unified core system quickly by leveraging the best existing components, centralizing logic, removing redundancy, and deferring the most complex cognitive features.
