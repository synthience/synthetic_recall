# Phase 5.9 Backend API Fixes

**Date:** 2025-04-06

**Status:** Completed

## Overview

This document details the fixes and improvements made to stabilize the API communication between the Synthians Cognitive Dashboard and the three core backend services (Memory Core, Neural Memory, and Context Cascade Engine). The work addressed critical 404 and 500 errors preventing the dashboard from properly displaying real-time system data.

## Context & Goal

The primary goal of this work phase was to resolve critical communication errors occurring between the **Synthians Cognitive Dashboard's backend proxy** and the **core backend services**. These fixes were necessary to enable the dashboard to fetch real-time status, metrics, configuration, and the newly implemented Phase 5.9 diagnostics/explainability data.

The objective was to establish stable and correct API communication pathways, laying the foundation for visualizing real data in the dashboard UI.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Memory Core Service Issues

#### 1.1 `/stats` Endpoint (500 Error)

- **Problem:** Internal `AttributeError` due to calling non-existent methods (`get_memory_count`, `check_index_health`).
- **Fix:**
  - Implemented robust error handling for vector index integrity checks
  - Added multiple fallback methods including `check_index_integrity`, `verify_index_integrity`, and `vector_index.verify_index_integrity`
  - Provided default values when no method is available
  - Ensured response structure matches `MemoryStatsData` from `shared/schema.ts`

#### 1.2 Config Runtime Endpoint (404 Error)

- **Problem:** Missing `/config/runtime/{service_name}` endpoint.
- **Fix:**
  - Implemented the missing endpoint to return sanitized runtime configuration
  - Used safe attribute access with getattr() and sensible defaults
  - Added validation for service name parameter

#### 1.3 Vector Index Drift Detection

- **Problem:** `TypeError` in `detect_and_repair_index_drift` with message "object tuple can't be used in 'await' expression".
- **Fix:**
  - Removed incorrect `await` from the `verify_index_integrity` call
  - Ensured proper handling of synchronous and asynchronous methods

### 2. Neural Memory Service Issues

#### 2.1 `/diagnose_emoloop` Endpoint (500 Error)

- **Problem:** `UnboundLocalError` due to using `emotion_entropy` before assignment in `metrics_store.py`.
- **Fix:**
  - Initialized `emotion_entropy = 0.0` before the conditional block
  - Added proper error handling to prevent similar issues

#### 2.2 Neural Memory Health (Timeout)

- **Problem:** Initial requests to NM timed out (20s), suggesting slow startup or excessive load.
- **Considerations:**
  - While not directly fixed, we noted that simplified health checks might be needed
  - Additional investigation may be required if timeouts persist

### 3. CCE Service Issues

#### 3.1 Missing `/status` Endpoint (404 Error)

- **Problem:** The CCE service (`orchestrator/server.py`) missing the `/status` endpoint.
- **Fix:**
  - Created a `CCEStatusPayload` Pydantic model for structured response
  - Implemented the endpoint with appropriate error handling
  - Included status, uptime, variant, and processing state information

#### 3.2 `/health` Endpoint Error (500 Error)

- **Problem:** AttributeError due to calling non-existent `orchestrator.get_uptime_seconds()`.
- **Fix:**
  - Revised endpoint to use safer attribute checks
  - Calculated uptime only if start_time is available
  - Implemented more robust error handling

#### 3.3 `/metrics/recent_cce_responses` Endpoint Error (500 Error)

- **Problem:** TypeError due to not awaiting the coroutine from `orchestrator.get_recent_metrics()`.
- **Fix:**
  - Added `await` for the coroutine returned by `get_recent_metrics()`
  - Added null checks for metrics array
  - Improved error logging with stack traces

### 4. Dashboard Proxy Issues

#### 4.1 Memory Core Config Routing Error

- **Problem:** Proxy routing to incorrect endpoint path for configuration.
- **Fix:**
  - Aligned proxy route target with implemented backend endpoint
  - Ensured consistent routing between dashboard and services

## Schema and API Integration

### 1. TypeScript Interfaces

- Added `CCEStatusData` and `CCEStatusResponse` interfaces to `shared/schema.ts`
- Updated existing interface types to match actual backend response structures

### 2. API Client Hooks

- Updated `useCCEStatus` to use the correct `CCEStatusResponse` interface
- Ensured proper type checking between frontend and backend

## Guiding Principles

The fixes and improvements implemented followed these core principles:

1. **State Correctness = Observability + Recoverability + Temporal Traceability**
   - Enhanced error logging and diagnostic information
   - Implemented robust fallback mechanisms
   - Maintained temporal consistency in data structures

2. **Human-Facing Engineering**
   - Improved error messages for better debugging
   - Added context-aware handling of exceptional cases
   - Designed for operational clarity

3. **Resilience as Narrative**
   - Designed systems to degrade gracefully
   - Provided meaningful context in error states
   - Implemented multi-layered fallbacks

4. **Correctness Culture**
   - Validated inputs and outputs at service boundaries
   - Ensured consistent type definitions across layers
   - Implemented proper error handling throughout

## Next Steps

With the backend communication layer now stable, the next phase involves integrating the fetched data into the dashboard's UI components:

1. **Update UI Components**
   - Identify components displaying placeholder data
   - Implement proper data fetching with hooks from `lib/api.ts`
   - Add loading and error states
   - Format data for display

2. **Feature Flag Integration**
   - Conditionally render Phase 5.9 features based on `explainabilityEnabled` flag
   - Ensure graceful degradation when features are disabled

3. **Final Testing**
   - Verify all dashboard views with real data
   - Test error handling for edge cases
   - Evaluate performance under load
