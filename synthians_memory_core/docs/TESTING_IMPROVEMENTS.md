# Memory Core Testing Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the improvements made to the testing infrastructure for the Synthians Memory Core component, addressing deprecation warnings and task cancellation issues that were previously occurring during test execution.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Test Fixture Enhancements

#### Memory Core Fixture Optimization

The `memory_core` fixture in `test_memory_core_updates.py` has been redesigned to prevent background tasks from starting during unit tests:

- Disabled persistence and decay background tasks by setting long intervals (`3600 * 24`)
- Implemented proper cleanup to ensure all resources are released after tests
- Added robust directory removal with retry logic to handle potential file system locking issues
- Replaced async locks with dummy versions for testing to prevent blocking during tests

```python
# Example of the improved fixture configuration
core = SynthiansMemoryCore(
    config={
        'embedding_dim': 384,
        'storage_path': test_dir,
        'vector_index_type': 'L2',
        'use_gpu': False,
        # Disable background tasks for unit testing updates
        'persistence_interval': 3600 * 24,
        'decay_interval': 3600 * 24,
    }
)
```

### 2. Background Task Management

#### Persistence Loop Improvements

The `_persistence_loop` method in `SynthiansMemoryCore` has been modified to prevent "no running event loop" errors during shutdown:

- Removed the final save attempt from the `finally` block that was causing errors during test teardown
- Improved shutdown sequence to ensure all tasks are properly cancelled

### 3. Event Loop Handling

#### Removal of Deprecated Fixtures

- Removed the custom `event_loop` fixture from `conftest.py` to eliminate deprecation warnings
- Updated to use pytest-asyncio's current recommended practices for async testing

### 4. Logging Enhancements

- Updated the `Logger` class to support both legacy and standard logging patterns
- Added better exception handling with `exc_info` support
- Made the logger more flexible with both context/message and standard logging calls

## Test Coverage

The following tests now run successfully without warnings or errors:

1. `test_get_memory_by_id` - Tests basic memory retrieval
2. `test_update_quickrecal_score` - Verifies QuickRecal score updates
3. `test_update_metadata` - Tests metadata update functionality
4. `test_update_invalid_fields` - Verifies error handling for invalid updates
5. `test_update_nonexistent_memory` - Tests error handling for non-existent memories
6. `test_update_persistence` - Verifies that updates are correctly persisted
7. `test_quickrecal_updated_timestamp` - Ensures timestamp update in metadata

## Remaining Considerations

### Configuration Options

The pytest-asyncio plugin still shows a configuration warning about `asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope` being unset. This can be addressed by setting the configuration explicitly in `pytest.ini` or `conftest.py`:

```python
# In conftest.py
def pytest_configure(config):
    config.option.asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope = "function"
```

Or in a pytest.ini file:

```ini
[pytest]
asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope = function
```

## Integration with Bi-Hemispheric Architecture

These testing improvements ensure the reliability of the Memory Core component, which is crucial for the Bi-Hemispheric Cognitive Architecture as it:

1. Provides stable testing for the persistence mechanism used by the system
2. Ensures the memory update endpoints function correctly for the surprise feedback loop
3. Validates the QuickRecal scoring mechanism essential for memory relevance 

Together, these improvements maintain the integrity of the testing infrastructure while allowing for continued development of the cognitive architecture.
