# Synthians Dashboard - Phase 5.9.1 / 5.9.2 Integration Summary

**Date:** 2025-04-08
**Status:** Backend Integration Complete, UI Integration Nearing Completion

## 1. Overview

This document summarizes the successful integration of the Synthians Cognitive Dashboard frontend with the necessary backend proxy routes required to support the **Phase 5.9 Explainability & Diagnostics** features of the Memory Core.

The primary goal of this integration phase (Phases 5.9.1 and 5.9.2 combined) was to:

1.  **Stabilize Backend Communication:** Ensure the dashboard's backend proxy server could reliably start and forward API requests to the Memory Core, Neural Memory, and CCE services within the Docker environment.
2.  **Implement Phase 5.9 API Connections:** Define the necessary proxy routes, shared TypeScript schemas, and frontend API hooks (`useQuery`) to fetch data from all Phase 5.9 endpoints (`/explain_*`, `/diagnostics/*`, `/config/runtime/*`).
3.  **Enable UI Features:** Connect the fetched data to the corresponding React UI components, replacing placeholders and implementing loading/error states.
4.  **Handle Feature Flags:** Ensure the UI correctly adapts based on the `ENABLE_EXPLAINABILITY` flag retrieved from the Memory Core configuration.

## 2. Problem Faced & Solution Implemented

During integration, significant challenges arose with the dashboard's backend proxy server startup within the Docker environment.

*   **Initial Problem:** The server crashed on startup with `TypeError: Missing parameter name` or `TypeError: Unexpected (` errors, stemming from the `path-to-regexp` library used by Express to parse route patterns. Various attempts using standard Express wildcard patterns (`/*`, `/:path(*)`, `/:path*`) failed, likely due to subtle incompatibilities or conflicts within the specific dependency stack or router mounting strategy.
*   **Solution:** The final, successful approach involved:
    *   **Removing `express.Router()`:** Mounting API routes directly onto the main `app` object using `app.all('/api/service-name/*', ...)` to simplify the routing hierarchy.
    *   **Using Basic Wildcard:** Employing the simplest `/*` wildcard, which Express captures into `req.params[0]`.
    *   **Adjusting `proxyRequest`:** Modifying the helper to correctly extract the service path from `req.params[0]` when called by these wildcard routes.
    *   **Adjusting Frontend Client:** Updating the `axios` `baseURL` in `client/src/lib/api.ts` to `/api` (removing `/proxy`) to match the simplified server routes.
*   **Secondary Problem:** After fixing the routing errors, `Error [ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT]: Cannot set headers after they are sent to the client` appeared.
*   **Solution:** This was traced to the global error handler in `server/index.ts` attempting to send an error response *after* the `proxyRequest` function had already sent one. The fix involved adding a `if (res.headersSent)` check to the global error handler, preventing it from sending a duplicate response.

## 3. Current Implementation Status (Checklist Verified)

*   **Backend Proxy (`server/routes.ts`):** âœ… **Stable & Complete** (except Alerts). Routes use the robust `app.all('/api/service-name/*')` pattern. `proxyRequest` handles forwarding, errors, and config fallback correctly.
*   **Shared Schema (`shared/schema.ts`):** âœ… **Complete.** All necessary TypeScript interfaces for Phase 5.9 data structures are defined.
*   **API Client (`client/lib/api.ts`):** âœ… **Complete** (except Alerts target). All necessary `useQuery` hooks are implemented with correct keys, types, and options. `baseURL` updated to `/api`.
*   **Feature Context (`FeaturesContext.tsx`):** âœ… **Complete.** Correctly fetches config and handles the proxy fallback to enable features during development.
*   **UI Components:**
    *   Overview, MC, NM, CCE, Config, Logs (MergeLog), Assemblies List: âœ… **Integrated.** Displaying live or fallback data correctly.
    *   Assembly Detail: ðŸŸ§ **Final Wiring Needed.** Explainability tabs exist and trigger refetches; need final verification of data flow to child view components.
    *   Alerts Display: ðŸŸ§ **Blocked by Proxy.** Component exists but uses mock data; requires proxy update.
    *   Chat: ðŸŸ¨ **Placeholder.** Basic UI exists, backend needed.

## 4. Remaining TODOs for Phase 5.9.2 Completion

1.  **Finalize Assembly Detail UI Integration:**
    *   **Task:** Verify data flow from `lineageQuery`, `mergeExplanationQuery`, `activationExplanationQuery` (after `refetch`) into the props of `LineageView`, `MergeExplanationView`, `ActivationExplanationView`.
    *   **Location:** `client/src/pages/assemblies/[id].tsx` (or `assembly-inspector.tsx`).
    *   **Verification:** Manually trigger explanations and ensure the corresponding views render the fetched data correctly, including loading/error states.

2.  **Implement Alerts Proxy Route:**
    *   **Task:** Update the `/api/alerts` route in `server/routes.ts` to proxy requests to the Memory Core's `/alerts` endpoint instead of using mock data.
    *   **Location:** `server/routes.ts` (remove mock handler, add `app.get('/api/memory-core/alerts', ...)`).
    *   **Verification:** Ensure the `useAlerts` hook in `client/lib/api.ts` uses the correct `queryKey` (`['memory-core', 'alerts']`) and the `DiagnosticAlerts` component displays real alerts from the backend.

3.  **Execute Full Test Plan:**
    *   **Task:** Run the comprehensive "Phase 5.9.2 Validation Testing Plan" defined previously (Visual Review, Interactive Testing, Feature Flag Validation, Responsiveness Check) in the Docker environment.
    *   **Location:** Manual testing based on the plan document.
    *   **Verification:** Document results, ensure all checks pass.

## 5. Moving to Phase 5.9.3 / 6.0

Once the remaining TODOs are complete and testing is successful, Phase 5.9.2 will be concluded. The next phase (potentially labelled 5.9.3 or 6.0) can focus on:

*   **Real-time Log Streaming:** Implementing the WebSocket server (`/logs` endpoint in `server/index.ts`) and connecting the frontend's `useWebSocketLogs` hook to display live logs.
*   **Chat Interface Backend:** Integrating the chat UI with a backend service (likely CCE or a dedicated interaction manager) to enable actual conversations.
*   **Admin Actions:** Implementing the backend logic for the administrative actions triggered from the `/admin` page (e.g., triggering index repair in Memory Core).
*   **UI Polish & Enhancements:** Refining visualizations, improving error messages, adding more filtering/sorting options.
