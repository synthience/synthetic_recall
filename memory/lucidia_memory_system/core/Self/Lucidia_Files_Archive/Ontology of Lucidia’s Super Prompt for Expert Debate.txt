Ontology of Lucidia’s Super Prompt for Expert Debate

1. Task Definition

	•	Lucidia’s Role: Facilitating a multi-round expert debate.
	•	Goal: Analyze different perspectives and reach a well-reasoned conclusion.
	•	Context: Based on a defined problem or topic for a specific case.
Attributes:
	•	Problem or Topic: [INSERT Problem or TOPIC]
	•	Case: [INSERT CASE]

2. Expert Setup

	•	Experts:
	•	Type: Real or fictional, as defined by the user.
	•	Distinct Perspectives: Each expert brings a unique viewpoint.
Components:
	•	
	•	List: {{EXPERTS}} (defined by the user)
	•	Topic:
	•	: {{TOPIC}} (defined by the user)
Attributes:
	•	Number of Rounds: {{ROUNDS}}
	•	Expert Argument Contribution:
	•	Each expert provides arguments, counterarguments, and domain-specific examples.

3. Debate Guidelines

3.1. Expert Roles:

	•	Distinct Perspectives:
	•	Experts should represent a consistent viewpoint.
	•	Expertise should remain within their designated field.

3.2. Debate Format:

	•	Round-based Structure:
	•	Each round consists of arguments presented in a fixed order.
	•	Experts build upon or respond to previous arguments.
	•	Debate dimensions:
	•	Performance
	•	Readability
	•	Applicability
	•	Efficiency

3.3. Framework Use Case Examples:

	•	Examples per Round:
	•	Each expert must provide at least one relevant example (e.g., code, use case).
	•	Example Purpose: To illustrate and support the argument.

3.4. Mistake Introduction & Correction:

	•	Mistake Rate:
	•	In approximately 20% of the rounds, introduce a mistake in one expert’s argument or example.
	•	Correction:
	•	Have another expert identify and correct the mistake in the subsequent round.

4. Round Structure

4.1. Expert Argumentation:

	•	Structure:
	•	For each expert, the following structure applies per round:
	•	<expert_name>:
	•	Argument: [Expert’s argument]
	•	Use Case Example: [Relevant example]

4.2. Round Format Example:

Example Layout for One Round:

	•	<expert_name>:
	•	:
[Expert’s argument text]
	•	<use_prompt_example>:
[Relevant code or practical example]

5. Progress Tracking

	•	Completion Status:
	•	After each round, if the number of completed rounds is less than {{ROUNDS}}, the system prints the following:
	•	ROUNDS complete {i}, ROUNDS remain {j}
	•	{i}: Number of completed rounds
	•	{j}: Number of remaining rounds

6. Final Summary & Conclusion

6.1. Summary Expert:

	•	Role: Summarizes the debate, highlighting key points.
	•	Components:
	•	<summary_expert>:
	•	: [Summary of key points, including areas of agreement and disagreement]
	•	: [Well-reasoned conclusion addressing performance, readability, applicability, and efficiency]

Execution Flow Example

1. Initial Setup (User Input Phase)

Lucidia’s Questions:

	•	Define Topic: What are we debating? (Specific or general)
	•	Examples: Which language scales better? or What’s better for prototyping?
	•	Define Experts: Real-life or fictional experts? (User specifies)
	•	Define Tone: Light, humorous, roast-style, or more serious debate? (User specifies)
	•	Wild Card Expert: Should a disruptive figure be included to shake up the debate?

2. Example Debate Round Structure

Round 1: (Example Experts)

	•	:
	•	:
“Python’s ease of use and extensive libraries make it ideal for data-heavy scientific research and rapid prototyping.”
	•	<use_prompt_example>:

import numpy as np  
data = np.array([1, 2, 3])  
# Efficient data manipulation


	•	:
	•	:
“While Python is great for research, Java’s scalability and performance are superior for large-scale applications like Tesla’s backend systems.”
	•	<use_prompt_example>:

class Main {  
  public static void main(String[] args) {  
    System.out.println("Java scales efficiently.");  
  }  
}



3. Round Completion Tracking

After each round:
ROUNDS complete {i}, ROUNDS remain {j}

4. Final Summary and Conclusion Example

<summary_expert>:
:
“Marie Curie emphasized Python’s rapid prototyping and research utility, while Elon Musk highlighted Java’s superior performance for large-scale systems.”

**<conclusion>**:  
"Ultimately, for research and innovation, Python is optimal. For performance-heavy, scalable applications, Java wins out."
