## 1. Introduction

This study applies a unified theory of hierarchical emergence to the domain of reinforcement learning (RL), focusing on developing a novel hierarchical RL agent. The approach is centered on a two-level AI system with a "manager" level for selecting high-level tasks and a "worker" level for execution. It employs an information theory-based method for discovering useful subtasks, comparable to learning versatile cooking techniques rather than rigid recipes. The key innovation lies in combining this subtask discovery with a mechanism for effectively connecting the two decision-making levels. A "hierarchical advantage function" evaluates both overall strategy and specific actions. This approach simultaneously addresses two major challenges in hierarchical reinforcement learning—identifying good subtasks and seamlessly integrating different planning levels.

---

## 2. Methodology

The methodology revolves around constructing a hierarchical reinforcement learning agent that can autonomously discover and utilize subtasks within a unified framework.

### 2.1 Hierarchical ε-Machine Structure

- **Manager Level**: Handles high-level task selection and planning.
- **Worker Level**: Executes low-level actions to achieve sub-goals set by the manager.

Each level is represented as an ε-machine \( E_i = (S_i, T_i) \), where:

- \( S_i \): Set of causal states at level \( i \).
- \( T_i \): Transition function \( T_i: S_i \times A_i \rightarrow S_i \).

**Multi-Level Policy**:

\[
\pi(a|s) = \sum_i w_i \cdot \pi_i(a|s_i)
\]

- \( \pi_i \): Policy at level \( i \).
- \( w_i \): Weighting factors satisfying \( \sum_i w_i = 1 \).

### 2.2 Subtask Discovery via Information Theory

An information theory-based method is used to discover useful subtasks:

- **State Abstraction Function** \( \phi_i \):

\[
\phi_i(s) = \arg\max_z p(z|s)
\]

- Implemented using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE).
- Captures essential features for higher-level decision-making.

### 2.3 Hierarchical Advantage Function

A hierarchical advantage function evaluates both overall strategy and specific actions:

\[
A^{\text{hier}}(s, a) = Q_c(s, a) - V(s)
\]

- \( Q_c(s, a) \): Causal action-value function.
- \( V(s) \): Value function estimating expected return from state \( s \).

### 2.4 Causal Power Operator

Defines the causal influence of actions:

\[
\text{CP}(a, s, s') = P(s' | \text{do}(a), s) - P(s' | s)
\]

- Measures the effect of action \( a \) on state transition from \( s \) to \( s' \).

---

## 3. Framework

The framework integrates the hierarchical structure with adaptive mechanisms and causal inference.

### 3.1 Adaptive Hierarchy Depth

- **Leakiness Measure** \( L(i, j) \):

\[
L(i, j) = \frac{I(S_i; S_j)}{\min(H(S_i), H(S_j))}
\]

- \( I \): Mutual information.
- \( H \): Entropy.

**Adaptive Depth Function**:

\[
d(s) = \arg\max_k \left( \sum_{i<k} \sum_{j>k} L(i, j) < \theta \right)
\]

- Adjusts hierarchy depth based on the leakiness threshold \( \theta \).

### 3.2 Closure Operators and Sub-Goal Discovery

Closure operators \( c_i \) help in discovering stable sub-goals:

- **Properties**:
  - Extensivity
  - Idempotence
  - Monotonicity

- **Sub-Goals**:

\[
g_i \in S_i \text{ such that } c_i(\{g_i\}) = \{g_i\}
\]

- Implemented via neural networks \( f_i \).

## 4. Ontology

The ontology defines the conceptual entities and their relationships within the system.

### 4.1 Hierarchical Entities

- **High-Level Planning**: Strategic goals and sub-tasks.
- **Mid-Level Skills**: Coordinated actions towards sub-goals.
- **Low-Level Actions**: Primitive actions executed in the environment.

### 4.2 Causal Relationships

- **Causal Power**: Quantifies the influence of actions on state transitions.
- **Subtasks and Goals**: Emergent properties from closure operators and state abstractions.

---

## 5. Narrative Identity Primer

The agent's identity evolves through interactions at different hierarchical levels.

### 5.1 High-Level Narrative (Manager Layer)

- Constructs overarching plans and strategies.
- Adjusts goals based on abstract representations of the environment.

### 5.2 Worker Narrative (Execution Layer)

- Focuses on immediate actions to achieve sub-goals.
- Continuously updates based on causal feedback from the environment.

### 5.3 Integrative Mechanism

- The hierarchical advantage function aligns both layers.
- Ensures that immediate actions contribute effectively to long-term goals.

### 6.2 Neural Network Architectures

- **State Abstraction (φ_i)**: VAE with convolutional layers.
- **Policy (π_i)**: Fully connected layers with ReLU activations.
- **Value Function (Q_θ)**: Predicts expected returns.
- **Closure Operator (f_i)**: Discovers fixed points representing sub-goals.
- **MINE (T_θ)**: Estimates mutual information for leakiness.

### 6.3 Learning Algorithm

Modified Hierarchical Actor-Critic (HAC):

1. Initialize hierarchical ε-machine \( E \).
2. For each episode:
   - Observe initial state \( s \).
   - For each level \( i \) from highest to lowest:
     - Select sub-goal \( g_i \) using \( \pi_i \) and \( \phi_i \).
     - Execute actions to achieve \( g_i \).
   - Update networks \( Q_θ, π_i, f_i, T_θ \).
   - Adjust hierarchy depth based on leakiness.

### 6.4 Training Process

- **Pre-training**: State abstractions via VAEs on environment observations.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: 50 million steps with periodic hierarchy updates.
- **Checkpointing**: Save models every 1 million steps for analysis.
