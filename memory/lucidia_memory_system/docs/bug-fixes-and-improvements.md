# Lucidia Memory System: Bug Fixes and Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines critical bug fixes and improvements implemented in the Lucidia memory system as of March 2025. These changes address several issues related to memory retrieval, tensor processing, and data serialization, enhancing the overall stability and performance of the system.

## Key Fixes

### 1. Recency-Biased Search Implementation

**File:** `memory/lucidia_memory_system/core/short_term_memory.py`

**Description:** Implemented the previously missing `recency_biased_search` method, which combines semantic similarity with recency bias to provide more contextually relevant memory retrieval. This method improves the quality of memory results by prioritizing both relevance and recency.

**Implementation Details:**
- Combined semantic similarity scores with recency metrics
- Applied configurable weighting between semantic and temporal relevance
- Implemented proper sorting and filtering based on combined scores

### 2. Coroutine Handling Improvements

**File:** `memory/lucidia_memory_system/core/memory_core.py`

**Description:** Fixed several issues related to unawaited coroutines in the memory system, particularly in the `_update_memory_access_timestamps` method.

**Implementation Details:**
- Added proper `await` statements for async function calls
- Improved error handling around coroutine execution
- Enhanced logging for coroutine-related issues

### 3. Tensor Size Handling Enhancement

**Files:**
- `memory/lucidia_memory_system/core/memory_core.py`
- `memory/lucidia_memory_system/core/integration/hpc_sig_flow_manager.py`

**Description:** Fixed inconsistencies in tensor size handling during embedding processing, ensuring that all tensors passed to the HPC system have consistent dimensions.

**Implementation Details:**
- Enhanced the `_preprocess_embedding` method to handle both 1D and 2D tensors
- Implemented padding and truncation to ensure consistent tensor dimensions
- Fixed tensor processing pipeline to maintain embedding integrity

### 4. Memory Access Timestamp Tracking

**File:** `memory/lucidia_memory_system/core/short_term_memory.py`

**Description:** Implemented the missing `update_access_timestamp` method in the ShortTermMemory class to properly track memory access patterns.

**Implementation Details:**
- Added functionality to update access counts and timestamps
- Ensured metadata consistency for memory entries
- Provided proper logging for timestamp updates

### 5. Binary Data Serialization

**File:** `memory/lucidia_memory_system/core/memory_entry.py`

**Description:** Completely rewrote the `to_dict` method to properly handle binary data serialization, preventing errors when storing memories with binary content.

**Implementation Details:**
- Implemented Base64 encoding for binary content
- Added type checking for all serialized fields
- Implemented fallback mechanisms for unserializable data
- Enhanced error handling during serialization process

### 6. PyTorch Deprecation Warning Fix

**File:** `memory/lucidia_memory_system/core/integration/hpc_sig_flow_manager.py`

**Description:** Addressed PyTorch deprecation warnings related to tensor transposition by updating code to use the recommended approaches for different tensor dimensions.

**Implementation Details:**
- Used dimension-specific transposition methods
- Implemented `.permute()` for higher-dimensional tensors
- Maintained compatibility with future PyTorch versions

## Technical Impact

These improvements significantly enhance the reliability and performance of the Lucidia memory system:

1. **Reliability**: Fixed critical errors related to coroutine handling and data serialization
2. **Performance**: Optimized tensor processing for better compatibility with the HPC system
3. **Memory Quality**: Enhanced memory retrieval through recency biasing and improved access tracking
4. **Future Compatibility**: Updated code to address deprecation warnings and ensure compatibility with future library versions

## Usage Notes

No changes to the public API were made as part of these fixes. All improvements were implemented as internal enhancements that maintain backward compatibility with existing code.

## Recommendations

1. Continue monitoring for potential issues with memory serialization, particularly with custom data types
2. Consider implementing periodic validation of memory integrity to ensure data consistency
3. Monitor performance metrics to assess the impact of the recency-biased search implementation
