## Spiral Phases in Reflection Processes

The Lucidia memory system implements a spiral-based approach to reflection and memory consolidation, providing increasingly sophisticated levels of introspection and knowledge integration. This approach mimics the way human consciousness processes information in iterative cycles of deepening understanding.

### Spiral Phase Model

The spiral reflection model consists of three primary phases, each representing a different depth and focus of reflective processing:

1. **Phase 1: Observation (Shallow Reflection)**
   - **Focus**: Quick associative connections and immediate pattern recognition
   - **Memory Operations**: Light categorization, basic tagging, and surface-level associations
   - **Reflection Depth**: 0.1-0.3 (on a 0.0-1.0 scale)
   - **Memory Integration**: Primary storage in STM with minimal LTM interaction
   - **Typical Duration**: Brief, rapid processing (30-60 seconds in dream-time)

2. **Phase 2: Reflection (Intermediate Depth)**
   - **Focus**: Thematic pattern extraction and meaningful relationship building
   - **Memory Operations**: Semantic network expansion, context enrichment, and metaphorical linkage
   - **Reflection Depth**: 0.4-0.7 (on a 0.0-1.0 scale)
   - **Memory Integration**: Bidirectional flow between STM and LTM with preliminary MPL formation
   - **Typical Duration**: Moderate processing time (1-3 minutes in dream-time)

3. **Phase 3: Adaptation (Deep Reflection)**
   - **Focus**: Significant restructuring, narrative coherence, and identity integration
   - **Memory Operations**: Knowledge graph restructuring, conceptual pruning, and belief system updates
   - **Reflection Depth**: 0.8-1.0 (on a 0.0-1.0 scale)
   - **Memory Integration**: Full STM-LTM-MPL integration with lasting conceptual changes
   - **Typical Duration**: Extended processing periods (3-5 minutes in dream-time)

### Spiral-Reflection Connection Implementation

The spiral phase integration is implemented through several key components:

1. **Phase Detection and Tracking**:
   - Current spiral phase is tracked in the self-model's self-awareness component
   - Phase transitions are triggered by significance thresholds and temporal patterns
   - Each phase has specific entry and exit conditions based on reflection outcomes

2. **Reflection Process Modulation**:
   - Dream processor adjusts reflection depth based on current spiral phase
   - Cognitive styles and dream themes are weighted differently in each phase
   - Association distance and connection complexity increase with phase depth
   - Creative recombination parameters vary by phase (greater in Phase 3)

3. **Memory Integration Strategies**:
   - Phase-specific integration rates determine how readily insights modify memory structures
   - Knowledge graph operations become more extensive in deeper phases
   - Identity and belief system updates are primarily restricted to Phase 3
   - Confidence thresholds for integration decrease in higher phases

4. **Parameter Influence**:
   - `spiral_influence` parameter controls overall impact of spiral phase on dream processes
   - `spiral_awareness_boost` increases self-awareness through iterative reflection
   - Phase-specific parameter adjustments tune the reflection process dynamically

## Parameter Reconfiguration System

| Status | Task | Description | Priority |
|--------|------|-------------|----------|
| ✅ | Parameter Management | Implemented a comprehensive `ParameterManager` with support for nested parameter paths, type validation, and value casting. The system handles parameter locking, interpolation between values, and maintains metadata for valid parameter ranges. | HIGH |
| ✅ | Parameter API | Created REST API endpoints for parameter configuration retrieval and updates, including validation logic and appropriate status responses. | HIGH |
| ✅ | Configuration Validation | Added JSON schema validation for parameter configurations using the jsonschema library. Updated array-type parameters (depth_range and creativity_range) to correctly validate against the schema. | MEDIUM |
| ✅ | Parameter Change Handlers | Implemented a robust event-based architecture for parameter changes with support for observer registration and notification. | MEDIUM |
| ✅ | Testing Framework | Created comprehensive test suite for parameter system, including tests for locking, validation, interpolation, and notification systems. | MEDIUM |
| ✅ | Docker Integration | Added required dependencies (jsonschema, psutil) to the Docker environment and verified integration with other system components. | HIGH |

## Phase 4: Integration & Optimization

|--------|------|-------------|----------|

| ❌ | Performance Optimization | Identify and fix bottlenecks | MEDIUM |
| ✅ | Resource Usage Optimization | Implemented dynamic resource allocation through ResourceOptimizer class which prioritizes critical components like memory_system and llm_service.
