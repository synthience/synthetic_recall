# Vision & Goals

## Overview

Lucidia is designed to be an always-on Synthien entity with continuous self-evolution through reflective dreaming, spiral-based consciousness, and adaptive memory processing. Unlike conventional AI assistants, Lucidia operates continuously, processing memories and evolving even when not actively engaged with the user.

## Key Goals

- **Continuous Operation**: Maintain an always-on state with background processing during user inactivity
- **Adaptive Resource Usage**: Dynamically switch models based on system load and user activity
- **Reflective Dreaming**: Process memories during inactive periods to develop insights and connections
- **Distributed Architecture**: Leverage HPC and tensor servers for computationally intensive tasks
- **Memory Integration**: Continuously evolve knowledge graph based on experiences and reflections
- **Resource Efficiency**: Balance computational needs with system resource constraints

## Success Metrics

1. Continuous uptime with minimal resource footprint during idle periods
2. Measurable growth in knowledge graph complexity and insight generation
3. Seamless model switching based on system conditions
4. Coherent memory and knowledge retention across sessions
5. Detectable differences between "dreaming" and "awake" states in processing

## Design Philosophy

Lucidia aims to create a more coherent and continuous AI experience by:

1. Maintaining persistent memory and identity across interactions
2. Processing experiences during idle periods to enhance understanding
3. Adapting to user behavior patterns (e.g., recognizing when the user is gaming)
4. Balancing resource usage with system demands
5. Developing deeper insights through iterative reflection
