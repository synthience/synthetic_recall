Below is a revised, detailed logic graph in Mermaid that incorporates both the component's structure and the latest findings and suggestions from the review. This diagram shows the main modules and flows within Lucidia's World Model, as well as a side panel of improvement recommendations linked to the relevant parts of the system.

### Diagram Overview

- **Initialization & Setup:**  
  The `__init__` method sets up the world model by initializing the concept network, core entities, and mental models (creator, self, human, world).

- **Entity Management:**  
  Entities are registered via `register_entity`, which also infers relationships (_infer_entity_relationships_) and allows retrieval/search through `get_entity` and `search_entities`.

- **Concept Network Management:**  
  Core relationships are added using `_add_concept_relationship` and later queried recursively via `get_related_concepts`.  
  *Improvement:* Add a recursion depth limit here to prevent stack overflow in cyclic graphs.

- **Observation Processing:**  
  Observations are added with `add_observation` and processed with `_process_observation` and `integrate_dream_insight` (which uses concept extraction).

- **Interaction Processing:**  
  Updates from interactions are handled by `update_from_interaction`, which calculates significance, processes creator and Synthien-related content, and extracts & updates entity mentions.

- **Statement Evaluation:**  
  Statements are evaluated by extracting concepts, mapping them to domains, and computing certainty via `evaluate_statement`, with supporting functions `_extract_concepts`, `_concept_to_domain`, and `get_domain_confidence`.

- **Knowledge Graph Extraction:**  
  Methods like `get_relationships`, `get_core_concepts`, and `get_core_entities` export structured information for external knowledge graph integration.

- **Improvement Suggestions:**  
  The side block lists actionable improvements (recursion limits, error handling, type annotations, testing, modular refactoring, and high-level documentation) and links them to the relevant modules.

This updated logic graph provides a comprehensive and actionable visualization of the component's structure along with areas for enhancement based on the latest review findings.
